# Home Assistant Configuration
This repository contains all of the configuration files for my [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) hub.

It serves two purposes:
* Provides a useful source of examples around how to configure Home Assistant
* Ensures that I have a backup of all of my configuration should something happen to the device.
