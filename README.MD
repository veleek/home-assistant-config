# Home Assistant Configuration
This repository contains all of the configuration files for my [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) hub.

It serves two purposes:
* Provides a useful source of examples around how to configure Home Assistant
* Ensures that I have a backup of all of my configuration should something happen to the device.

Files that contain are excluded from the git repo in the `.gitignore`.  When moving this to a new machine you need to 
manually copy those files.  See the [services repo](https://github.com/veleek/pi-services) for a script to do so.
